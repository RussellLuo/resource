Resource
========

A library concentrated on the Resource layer of RESTful API.


Philosophy
----------

You have data somewhere:

1. physical data stored in databases like MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL (RDBMS)
2. virtual data existed in applications

and you want to expose it to your users through a RESTful Web API. `Resource` is a convenient library that allows you to do so.

`Resource` is database agnostic and web framework agnostic, which means you should/can choose databases (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) and web frameworks (Flask, Django, etc.) yourself.
